# Full-Triple-Matcher

## Description
Knowledge Graph Integration for Domain-Specific Applications

This repository contains the code and resources for the research article on integrating large-scale and domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs). While general-purpose KGs like DBpedia and YAGO offer broad coverage across various domains, they often lack the contextual depth required for specialized applications such as recommendation systems. Domain-specific KGs, on the other hand, provide semantically rich representations of focused areas like healthcare or education.

This project addresses the interoperability challenges between these heterogeneous KGs and proposes methods to integrate them effectively. The goal is to support advanced, context-aware applications by enabling seamless knowledge sharing across domains.
Main Features:

-	Tools and methods for integrating general-purpose and domain-specific KGs
-	Code for entity and schema alignment
- Experimental setup for evaluating KG integration effectiveness

## Installation

The environment.yml file contains all the libraries required to run the matcher.

## Folder description
The folders are distributed as follow:

-   codes: Contains all the source code and scripts used in this project. The entity matchers contains multiple version of our tested algorithm.
-   dataset: Includes the dataset utilized for experiments and evaluation.
-   results: Stores the output generated by the matchers, including all calculated results.

## Running the project

The current dataset folder contains only the gold standards and the input knowledge graphs (KGs) for DW-NB and DY-NB. To use the dataset for the unsupervised method, please visit the [OAEI website](https://oaei.ontologymatching.org). Additionally, you can set up the DBpedia endpoint by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/dbpedia/virtuoso-sparql-endpoint-quickstart).

Step 1: Compute Functionality and Inverse Functionality

Run the following notebook to calculate the functionality and inverse functionality of each KG:

    codes/entity-matching/FTM - Calculate inverse functionality.ipynb

Step 2: Run the Matching Algorithm

Execute the early stopping version of the FTM algorithm:

    codes/entity-matching/FTM - early stop.ipynb

Step 3: Evaluate the Results

- To calculate the hit rate, run:

    codes/entity-matching/Analyzing top@n.ipynb

- To compute precision, recall, and F1-score, run:

    codes/entity-matching/Analyze paris and ftm matches.ipynb

(optional) Step 4: Triple Matching

The entity matching also produces the matching between triple, but you can also obtain it separately if you already have the entity pairs. To this end, run:

codes/triple-matching/Calculate triple similarity.ipynb
